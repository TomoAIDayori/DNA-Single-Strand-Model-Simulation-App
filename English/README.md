## 🧬 Overview

**DNA Single-Strand Model Simulation App** is a C-language simulation tool to model the random motion of single-stranded DNA polymers.

It was designed for:

- Researchers in bioinformatics and physical chemistry
- Students learning about random walks or polymer physics
- Anyone seeking to visualize polymer behavior in a simple way

The simulation uses a **random walk algorithm** and outputs both statistical data and visualizations for each simulation step.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🎲 **Random Walk Simulation**
    - Simulates the random movement of a single-stranded polymer.
    - Outputs coordinates/configuration at each step.

- 🖼 **Stepwise Visualization**
    - Automatically generates images showing the polymer shape at selected simulation steps.
    - Supports PNG conversion via external scripts.

- 📊 **Export of Statistical Data**
    - Calculates key metrics such as:
        - **Radius of Gyration**
        - **Stability Metrics**
    - Outputs results in CSV format (Excel-compatible).
